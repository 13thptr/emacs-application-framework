# What is Emacs Application Framework?
Emacs Application Framework is a development framework that developers can develop any PyQt program and integrate into Emacs.

This framework mainly implements three functions:
1. Integrate PyQt program window into Emacs Frame using Xlib Reparent technology
2. Listening to EAF buffer's keyboard event flow and controlling the keyboard input of PyQt program via DBus IPC
3. Created a window compositer to make the PyQt program window adapt Emacs's Window/Buffer design

Using this framework, you can use PyQt develop powerful graphics programs to extend Emacs

### Why this awesome framework can't works with MacOS?
There are mainly three obstacles:
1. I can't make dbus/python-dbus works on MacOS High Sierra
2. This framework need use X11 reparent to stick Qt5 window to emacs frame, but i don't know how to make X11 works on MacOS.
3. Qt5 QGraphicsView/QGraphicsScene can't work MacOS, specify QGraphicsVideoItem can't work.
