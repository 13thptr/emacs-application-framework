;; In the past, textbooks were sometimes published as 'interleaved'
;; editions.  That meant, each page was followed by a blank page and
;; ambitious students/scholars had the ability to take their notes
;; directly in their copy of the textbook.  Newton and Kant were
;; prominent representatives of this technique.

;; Nowadays textbooks (or lecture material) come in PDF format.  Although almost
;; every PDF Reader has the ability to add some notes to the PDF itself, it is
;; not as powerful as it could be.

;; This is what this minor mode tries to accomplish.  It presents your PDF side by
;; side to an [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] buffer with your notes, narrowing
;; down to just those passages that are relevant to the particular page in the
;; document viewer.

;;; Usage:

;;; Code:

(require 'org)
(require 'org-element)

(defcustom eaf-interleave-org-notes-dir-list '("~/org/interleave_notes" ".")
  "List of directories to look into when opening notes org from a pdf file.

The notes file is assumed to have the exact
same base name as the pdf file (just that the file extension is
.org instead of .pdf).

If the notes org file is not found, it is created in the
directory returned on doing `car' of this list (first element of
the list).

The notes file is searched in order from the first list element
till the last; the search is aborted once the file is found.

If a list element is \".\" or begins with \"./\", that portion is
replaced with the pdf directory name.  e.g. \".\" is interpreted
as \"/pdf/file/dir/\", \"./notes\" is interpreted as
\"/pdf/file/dir/notes/\"."
  :type '(repeat directory))

If nil both buffers are split equally.  If the number is positive,
the window is enlarged.  If the number is negative, the window is
shrunken.

  "Interleaving your text books since 2015.

In the past, textbooks were sometimes published as 'interleaved' editions.
That meant, each page was followed by a blank page and the ambitious student/
scholar had the ability to take their notes directly in their copy of the
textbook. Newton and Kant were prominent representatives of this technique.

Nowadays textbooks (or lecture material) come in PDF format. Although almost
every PDF Reader has the ability to add some notes to the PDF itself, it is
not as powerful as it could be.

This is what this minor mode tries to accomplish. It presents your PDF side by
pppside to an [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] buffer with your notes, narrowing
down to just those passages that are relevant to the particular page in the
document viewer.

The split direction is determined by the customizable variable
`eaf-interleave-split-direction'. When `eaf-interleave-mode' is invoked
with a prefix argument the inverse split direction is used
e.g. if `eaf-interleave-split-direction' is 'vertical the buffer is
split horizontally."
