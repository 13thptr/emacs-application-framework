## Why choose Qt?
Qt's QGraphicsView and QGraphicsScene is awesome, it's easier to implement window composite than other GUI library (such as GTK+).

If use Gtk+ or other GUI library, i need write many Widget/XComposite code to implement widget like QGraphicsView/QGraphicsScene.

## Why choose Python?
C/C++ need compile long time for every change, this will interrupt my attention and development enthusiasm.

Python is perfect language to develop Qt program and it can call pretty much every library you need.

## Let me run hello word
```
M-x eaf-open
```

    Then type "eaf rocks!" as input, will pop hello world window in emacs like below:

    It's a big hello button, try to click it, haha.

## Develop new plugin
It's very easy if you know how to write PyQt5 code.

Here have awesome tutorial help you study PyQt5: http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/

Trust me, PyQt5 is pretty easy to study.

After you know how to write PyQt5 code, develop new plugin just need 3 steps:

1. Open file [buffer.py](app/demo/buffer.py):
```Python
from PyQt5.QtGui import QColor
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QPushButton
from buffer import Buffer

class DemoBuffer(Buffer):
    def __init__(self, buffer_id, url, width, height):
        Buffer.__init__(self, buffer_id, url, width, height, True, QColor(0, 0, 0, 255))

        self.add_widget(QPushButton("Hello, EAF hacker, it's work!!!"))
        self.buffer_widget.setStyleSheet("font-size: 100px")
```

    Replace QPushButton with your PyQt5 widget.

2. Open file [eaf.py](core/eaf.py):
```Python
    @dbus.service.method(EAF_DBUS_NAME, in_signature="ss", out_signature="s")
    def new_buffer(self, buffer_id, url):
        global emacs_width, emacs_height

        if url == "eaf rocks!":
            self.create_buffer(buffer_id, DemoBuffer(buffer_id, url, emacs_width, emacs_height))
```

    Replace "eaf rocks!" to "i am rocks!"

3. Test
    Execute command `eaf-stop-process' to kill old python process.

    Execute command `eaf-open' and type "i am rocks!".

    See? it's so easy!

    Above are all you need, happy hacking!
